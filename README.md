Small project to try to gain some familiarity with ML/GPT's.

Largely based on the video lectures by Andrej Karpathy on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ), I decided to try to predict next notes by training on Bach.

The results are largely unimpressive, likely due to a limited dataset (~80K notes). I initially tried to use 2 voices, but switched to single voice to lower the vocabulary size.
